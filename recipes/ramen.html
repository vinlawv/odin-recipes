        <h2>Take the usual ramen up a notch with this quick homemade ramen. Fresh veggies and herbs

            <p>Fresh vegetables? Quick and easy homemade broth? A soft-boiled egg and a pile of our 
            favorite curly-cue packaged ramen noodles that remind us of college? Thatâ€™s this 
            homemade ramen. This recipe leans more in the direction of 
            I-have-a-package-of-ramen-and-some-vegetables-can-we-make-lunch practical. 
            Sort of healthy and fast and a little nostalgic (packaged ramen!) but also fresh-ly 
            delicious with a ton of flavor.</p>
