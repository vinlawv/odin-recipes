        <h4 id="tacos-main">Tips</h4>
        <ul class="body">
            <li>Create a small condiment bar to serve alongside your easy ground beef tacos: 
                in addition to the lettuce, tomato and cheese, set out small bowls of chopped 
                avocado, sliced radishes, sweet bell pepper, additional salsa and fresh 
                cilantro.</li>
            <li>Turn these Easy Beef Tacos into taco bowls by spooning the salsa-seasoned 
                beef onto a bed of shredded lettuce, topped with the tomatoes and cheese. 
                Sprinkle with crushed tortilla chips for added crunch.</li>
            <li>Look for shredded Mexican cheese blends where you’d find the Cheddar 
                cheese—they’re a mix of Cheddar, Monterey Jack, Colby, and sometimes a 
                sprinkle of mild chili powder.</li>
        </ul>
